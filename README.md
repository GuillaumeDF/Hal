# Hal

The goal of this project is to implement an interpreter for a minimalist dialect of LISP in Haskell.

Our dialect of Lisp is functionnal (almost no side effects or mutable states), and a subset of Scheme. There- fore, an expression evaluated by your interpreter must give the same result as the same expression evalu- ated by a Scheme interpreter.
